# Lyric Generation - Red Hot Chili Peppers
Author: Katarina Salcedo

# Motivation
On average it take anywhere from 3-30 months to complete an album. My goal is to come up with a solution to streamline this process and assist with the creation of new songs that can be used in upcoming albums. Since each artist is unique - I will focus on a single artist, in this case the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and use deep learning to generate new song lyrics that match the style and voice of that artist. I will also use machine learning to predict the popularity score given the generated lyrics.
