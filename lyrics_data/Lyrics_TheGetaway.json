Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't know my mind, you don't know my kind\nDark necessities are part of my design and\nTell the world that I'm falling from the sky\nDark necessities are part of my design\n\n[Verse 2]\nStumble down to the parking lot, you got\nNo time for the afterthought, they're like\nIce Cream for an Astronaut, well, that's me looking for we\nTurn the corner and find the world at your command\nPlayin' the hand, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't know my mind, you don't know my kind\nDark necessities are part of my design\nTell the world that I'm falling from the sky\nDark necessities are part of my design\n[Bridge]\nDo you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine\nDo you want it, do you want it now?\nDo you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine\nDo you want it, do you want it now?\n\n[Verse 3]\nAh, pick you up like a paperback with the\nTrack record of a maniac so I\nMove it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday\nAny way we roll, everything must go away\nOh, what do you say?
