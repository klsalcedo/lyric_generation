Who you want to be?\nWhat you want to do? Just come with me\nOh, I saw God and I saw the fountains\nYou and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains\nMe, oh my, oh, me and Guy O\nFreer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio\nAround the world, I feel dutiful\nTake a wife 'cause life is beautiful\n\n[Chorus]\nI know, I know for sure\nDing, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang\nI know, I know it's you\nDing, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang\nMother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough\nI've been around the world and I have seen your love\nI know, I know it's you\nYou say \"Hello\" and then I say \"I do\"10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
