Will fathers help me decide?\nA jagged flash of light struck me in the eye\nI turned around and found that I was still alive\nSnakes rise high from the purple-black sky\nThe red cloud rains, and the black horse rides\nThen it dawned on me like the mornin' sun\nI'm a part of two worlds, and the mornin' comes\nGlowing embers tend to remember when\nThe power that is peace was treated as a friend\nI'm a master of a destin' and I got to take action\nI'm a man, the animal manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She's my sexy Mexican maid\n[Verse 3]\nShe puts me in a bubble bath\nShe tickles me, and I laugh\nShe washes me until I'm clean, then she does a little sexy dance\nHappy to feel my hand go slap upon her sexy ass\nWe make fun so very slow, then we make it very fastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
