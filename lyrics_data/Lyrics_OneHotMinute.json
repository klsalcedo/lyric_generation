Ooh Shit!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWent off and got some hair cuts\nLooking wild and got all drugged up\nHopped a train into the night\nGot a ride with a transvestite\nTwo boys in San Francisco\nTwo boys in San Francisco\nBlasted off in a BART bathroom\nThose coppers woke us up\nThe motherfuckers woke us up\n\n[Chorus 2]\nTwo young brothers on a hovercraft\nTelepathic love and belly laughs\n\n[Verse 3]\nStorm the stage of Universal\nSlim shine talk boy go subversal\nPapa's proud and so he sent us\nPounding hearts full and relentless\nTwo boys in London, England\nTwo boys in London, England\nClimbing out of hostel windows\nWearing gear so out but in though\nCome on kid and do the no, no\n[Chorus 2]\nTwo young brothers on a hovercraft (yeah)\nTelepathic love and belly laughs (oh yeah)\n\n[Chorus 1]\n(Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!)\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe went to Fairfax High School\nJumped off buildings into their pools\nWe'd sit down and grease at Canters\nRun like hell they can't catch us\nTwo boys in L.A. proper\nTwo boys in L.A. proper\nStealing anything that we could\nGot to sneak into the Starwood\nGot to peak into the deep good\n\nI remember\n10 years ago in Hollywood\nWe did some good\nAnd we did some real bad stuff\nBut the Butthole Surfers said\nIt's better to regret something you did\nThan something you didn't do\nYea, we were young\nAnd we were looking\nLooking\nLooking for that deep kick\nYeah, (I've) seen them come, seen them go\n[Outro]\n(And I feel I'm getting close to you)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "Oh yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nPersistent mist that faults my vision\nPsycho-exist point of collision\nIt's raining in my cranium\nMy head feels like a stadium\n\n[Verse 2]\nThree pound of gray about to burst\nInside my three pound universe\nIt's raining in my cranium\nMy head feels like a stadium\n\n[Chorus]\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nSymbols I've been given to express my goal\nAlways come up short, you know they just don't get that low\nIt's raining in my cranium\nMy head feels like a stadium\n\n[Chorus]\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\n[Chorus]\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\nThese are the melancholy mechanics of my mind\n\n[Outro]\nQuick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision\nBio-organic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation\nCleaner than light, meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000\nBillions of micro maniacs unknown to most\nAs the uncontrollable soldiers of suffering succotash\nInstantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bus station frustration\nAlone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation\nI wait\nI wait\nFor the wave to breakEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
