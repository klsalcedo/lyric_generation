Boy I'm tellin' you\nShe stuck my butt with her big black stick\nI said \"What's up? Now suck my dick\"\nLike a ram getting ready to jam the lamb\nShe whimpered just a little when she felt my hand\nOn her crotch, so very warm\nI could feel her getting wet through her uniform\nProppin' her up on the black and white\nUnzipped and slipped, \"Ooh, that's tight\"\nI swatted her like no swat team can\nTurned a cherry pie right into jam\n[Chorus]\nSir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that you met one time)\nSir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that'll leave you blind)\nSir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)\nSir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah\n\n[Verse 4]\nHello young woman that I love\nPretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of\nHold me naked if you will\nIn your arms, in your legs, in your pussy, I'd kill\nTo be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you\nI love you\n\n[Bridge]\nLay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down\nLay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down\nDescending waves of graceful pleasure\nFor your love, there is no measure\nHer curves they bend with subtle splendor\n\n[Verse 5]\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the funk will make me freak\nIf I should die before I waked\nAllow me Lord to rock out naked\nBored by the ordinary time to take a trip\nCalling up a little girl with a bull whip\nLickety split go snap \"snap\"\nGirl gettin' off all in my lap\nThe tallest tree the sweetest sap\nBlowin' my ass right off the map\nOoh and it's nice out here\nI think I'll stay for a while\n[Instrumental Outro]7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
