Oh\nTell me, lover, are you lonely?\nThe thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh\nTell me, baby, what's your story?\nWhere do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh\nYou're so lovely, are you lonely?\nOh, giving up on the innocence you left behind\n[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]\nSome claim to have the fortitude\nToo shrewd to blow the interlude\nSustaining pain to set a mood\nStep out to be renewed\nI'll move you like a baritone\nJungle Brothers on the microphone\nGetting over with an undertone\nIt's time to turn to stone\n\n[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]\nChitty-chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty-gritty\nLife could be a little sweet, but life could be a little shitty\nWhat a pity, Boston and a Kansas City\nLooking for a hundred, but you only ever found a fifty\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]\nThree fingers in the honeycomb\nYou ring just like a xylophone\nDevoted to the chromosome\nThe day that you left home\n\n[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]\nTell me, baby, what's your story?\nWhere you come from and where you wanna go this time?
